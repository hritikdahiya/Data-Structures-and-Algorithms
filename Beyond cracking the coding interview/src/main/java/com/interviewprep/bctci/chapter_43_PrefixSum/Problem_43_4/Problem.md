# BALANCE POINT

## Problem statement

Given an array of integers, arr, return the first balanced index, if there is any, or -1 otherwise. An index is balanced
if the sum of the elements to its left is the same as the sum of the elements to its right.

## Constraints

- The length of arr is at most 10^5
- Each element in arr is an integer at most 10^4

## Example 1

### Input

arr = [3, 5, -2, 7, 2, 2, 2]

### Output

3

Index 3 is balanced because 3 + 5 + (-2) equals 2 + 2 + 2.
