# SMALLER PREFIXES

## Problem statement

Given an array of integers, arr, where the length, n, is even, return whether the following condition holds for every k
in the range 1 ≤ k <= n/2: "the sum of the first k elements is smaller than the sum of the first 2k elements." If this
condition is false for any k in the range, return false.

## Example 1

### Input

arr = [1, 2, 2, -1]

### Output

True. The prefix [1] has a smaller sum than the prefix [1, 2], and the
prefix [1, 2] has a smaller sum than the prefix [1, 2, 2, -1]. The other
prefixes have length > n/2.

## Example 2

### Input

arr = [1, 2, -2, 1, 3, 5]

### Output

False. The prefix [1, 2] has a larger sum than the prefix [1, 2, -2,
1].
