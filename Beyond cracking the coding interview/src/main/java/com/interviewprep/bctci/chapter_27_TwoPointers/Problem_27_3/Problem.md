# ARRAY INTERSECTION

## Problem statement

Given two sorted arrays, arr1 and arr2, return their intersection.

The intersection is a new array that contains all elements that appear in both arrays, in sorted order, including
duplicates.

## Constraints

- The input arrays are sorted in ascending order
- 0 ≤ arr1.length, arr2.length ≤ 10^6
- -10^9 ≤ arr1[i], arr2[i] ≤ 10^9

## Example 1

### Input

arr1 = [1, 2, 3]
arr2 = [1, 3, 5]

### Output

[1, 3]

## Example 2

### Input

arr1 = [1, 1, 1]
arr2 = [1, 1]

### Output

[1, 1]
