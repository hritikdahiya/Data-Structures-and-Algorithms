# LINKED-LIST-BASED STACK

## Problem statement

Implement a Stack class using a singly linked list.

It should support the following methods:

```
push(v):
    Adds a value v at the top of the stack.

pop():
    Removes the value at the top of the stack and returns its value.
    If the stack is empty, returns None.

peek():
    Returns the value at the top of the stack without removing it.
    If the stack is empty, returns None.

size():
    Returns the number of elements in the stack.

empty():
    Returns True if the stack is empty, False otherwise.
```

## Constraints

- If your language is typed, you can either make the type of the stack elements generic, or use integers.
- All the methods should take O(1) time if the elements are integers.
- The stack can contain up to 10^5 elements.
- Do not use a dynamic array. You have to implement the linked list from scratch.

## Example 1

```
stack = Stack()
stack.pop()      # Returns None (empty stack)
stack.peek()     # Returns None (empty stack)
stack.size()     # Returns 0
stack.empty()    # Returns True
stack.push(1)    # Stack is now: 1
stack.push(2)    # Stack is now: 1->2
stack.push(3)    # Stack is now: 1->2->3
stack.peek()     # Returns 3
stack.size()     # Returns 3
stack.empty()    # Returns False
stack.pop()      # Returns 3, stack is now: 2->1
stack.pop()      # Returns 2, stack is now: 1
stack.pop()      # Returns 1, stack is now empty
stack.empty()    # Returns True
```
