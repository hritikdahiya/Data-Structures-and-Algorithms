# SUBLIST REVERSAL

## Problem statement

Given the head, head, of a singly linked list, and two indices, left and right, with 0 â‰¤ left < right, reverse all nodes
between the two indices in place and return the new head of the list.

If left is beyond the last index, do not modify the list. If only right is beyond the last index, reverse everything up
to the last node.

## Constraints

- You have to create the Node class with an integer val field and a next pointer.
- The list can contain up to 10^5 nodes.

## Example 1

### Input

head = 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> null
left = 1
right = 3

### Output

1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5 -> null

The first node (index 0) and the last node (index 4) stay the same

## Example 2

### Input

head = 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> null
left = 2
right = 7

### Output

1 -> 2 -> 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> null

All nodes starting at index 2 are reversed because index 7 is beyond
the last index

## Example 3

### Input

head = 1 -> 2 -> null
left = 5
right = 6

### Output

1 -> 2 -> null

left is out of bounds, so we leave the list untouched
