# SUBGRID MAXIMUS

## Problem statement

Given a rectangular RxC grid of integers, grid, with R > 0 and C > 0, return a new grid with the same dimensions where
each cell [r, c] contains the maximum in the subgrid with [r, c] in the top-left corner and [R-1, C-1] in the
bottom-right corner.

## Constraints

- 1 ≤ R, C ≤ 10^3
- -10^4 ≤ grid[i][j] ≤ 10^4

## Example 1

### Input

grid = [[1, 5, 3],
[4,-1, 0],
[2, 0, 2]]

### Output

[[5, 5, 3],
[4, 2, 2],
[2, 2, 2]]

## Example 2

### Input

grid = [[5]]

### Output

[[5]]

Explanation: For a 1x1 grid, each cell's subgrid is just itself.

## Example 3

### Input

grid =  [[1, 2, 3]]

### Output

[[3, 3, 3]]

Explanation: For a single row, each cell's subgrid includes all elements to
its right.
