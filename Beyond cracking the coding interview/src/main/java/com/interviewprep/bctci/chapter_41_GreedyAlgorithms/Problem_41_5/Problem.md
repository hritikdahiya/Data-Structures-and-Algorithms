# FEWEST SCRIPT RUNS

## Problem statement

There are n meetings scheduled, each with a start time and an end time. We have a script that, when run, captures some
information about all ongoing meetings. Given an array, meetings, where each element is a tuple [l, r] with l < r,
what's the minimum number of times we need to run the script to capture information from all meetings?

If the script runs at the same time that a meeting starts or ends, it captures the information for that meeting.

## Constraints

- 0 <= n <= 10^5
- 0 <= meetings[i][0] < meetings[i][1] <= 10^9

## Example 1

### Input

meetings = [[2, 3], [1, 4], [2, 3], [3, 6], [8, 10]]

### Output

2

We can run the script at t = 3 and t = 9.
