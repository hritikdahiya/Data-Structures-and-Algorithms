# MAGIC BLACKJACK

## Problem statement

You're given a magic deck of cards. When one card is removed, an identical card spawns as a replacement. Each card is a
number between 1 and 10 (suits do not matter). When a card is drawn, each value from 1 to 10 has a 10% chance of
appearing.

A dealer repeatedly draws cards until one of two things happen:

The sum of the cards is between 16 and 21.
The sum of the cards exceeds 21. When this happens, we say the dealer busts.
Return the number of different ways the dealer can bust.

For instance, if the dealer draws 10, 2, 10, they bust. If they draw 2, 10, 10, that counts as a different way to bust.
If the dealer draws 10, 1, 10, they don't bust.
