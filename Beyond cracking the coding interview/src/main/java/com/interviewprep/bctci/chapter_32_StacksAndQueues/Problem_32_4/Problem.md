# CURRENT URL

## Problem statement

You are implementing the back arrow functionality of a browser. You are given a non-empty array, actions, with the
actions that the user has done so far. Each element in actions consists of two elements. The first is the action type,
"go" or "back".

- When the action is "go", the second element is a URL string. The first action is always "go".
- When the action is "back", the second element is a number â‰¥ 1 with the number of times we want to go back. Going back
  once means returning to the previous URL we went to with a "go" action. If there are no previous URLs, going back
  stays at the current one.

Return the current URL the user is on after all actions are performed.

## Constraints

- The length of actions is at most 10^5
- Each URL is a non-empty string of length at most 100

## Example 1

### Input

actions = [["go", "google.com"],
["go", "wikipedia.com"],
["go", "amazon.com"],
["back", 4],
["go", "youtube.com"],
["go", "netflix.com"],
["back", 1]]

### Output

"youtube.com"
